The landscape of artificial intelligence is going through a paradigm shift with leaving a big impact on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The journey of transformation from basic word-based tokenization to sophisticated subword algorithms has led us to a stage where the conventional methods no longer suffice for advanced AI capabilities. Introduction of the Over-Tokenized Transformer framework and TokenFormer architecture have brought a revolutionary change offering 15-20% improvement in MMLU-Var benchmarks, reduced memory footprint, faster inference times and a lot more. Another significant advancement is the introduction of Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) that has brought improved inference efficiency, better scaling characteristics and has shown competitive results with traditional tokenization models. Despite these recent advances, there are challenges and concerns related to the balance between efficiency and accuracy, integration with existing systems, computation resources among few others.

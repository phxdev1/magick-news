## The Rise of Kubernetes in ML Engineering

The marriage between Kubernetes and machine learning isn't just a trendâ€”it's a necessity born from the complex requirements of modern ML workflows. Recent data indicates that by 2025, over 95% of new digital workloads will be deployed on cloud-native platforms, with Kubernetes leading this transformation. For ML engineers, this shift represents both an opportunity and a challenge: while Kubernetes offers unprecedented scalability and resource management capabilities, it also introduces a steep learning curve.

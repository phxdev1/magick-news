As dawn breaks over the sprawling facility, the air fills with the focused energy of German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois, and other specialized breeds participating in their daily training regimens.

The training methodology employed at Mir Pur Khas reflects years of refined techniques and international best practices. Each dog undergoes a rigorous selection process before entering the program, ensuring only the most capable candidates make it through to serve in Pakistan's elite K-9 units.

The Mir Pur Khas center is part of a larger network of Army Dog Centers strategically positioned across Pakistan's provinces. This network ensures that every corner of the nation has access to these specialized canine units when needed.

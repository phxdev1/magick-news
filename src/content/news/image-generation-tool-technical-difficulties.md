subtitle: "System downtime impacts content publishing workflow"
description: "The image generation tool used in our content publishing workflow is currently experiencing technical difficulties, causing delays in the final preparation of articles. While the written content is complete and ready for publication, the addition of header images remains pending until the tool's functionality is restored. The technical team is actively working to resolve the issues and restore normal operations. Despite this temporary setback, the quality and substance of our articles remain unaffected, with only the visual elements requiring attention once the system is back online."

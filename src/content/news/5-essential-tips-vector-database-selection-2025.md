## Tip 1: Evaluate Scalability and Performance Requirements

When selecting a vector database in 2025, scalability should be your primary consideration. Modern vector databases must handle:

- Horizontal Scalability: The ability to add more nodes to distribute workload
- Vertical Scalability: Capacity to handle larger vector dimensions
- Query Performance at Scale: Maintaining low latency with growing data volumes

Performance Metrics to Consider:
- Query latency under varying loads
- Throughput capabilities 
- Index building speed
- Memory efficiency

## Tip 2: Assess Integration Capabilities and Ecosystem Compatibility

Modern vector databases should seamlessly integrate with:
- Popular ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Development tools and pipelines
- Existing data infrastructure

## Tip 3: Consider Cost Structure and Resource Optimization

Understanding the total cost of ownership (TCO) involves analyzing:
- Licensing fees
- Infrastructure costs
- Operational expenses
- Maintenance requirements

## Tip 4: Prioritize Security and Compliance Features

Modern vector databases must provide:
- End-to-end encryption
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Authentication mechanisms

## Tip 5: Evaluate Implementation and Maintenance Support

Consider the availability of:
- Technical documentation
- Implementation guides
- Professional services
- Training resources

Our technical team has identified and is actively working to resolve ongoing issues affecting the image generation service. The temporary disruption has impacted the ability to create and display AI-generated header images for articles and other content. Engineers are implementing fixes to restore full functionality and ensure consistent image delivery across the platform. Normal service is expected to resume shortly. 

In the meantime, we appreciate your patience as we work to optimize the system and enhance reliability. The core content publishing capabilities remain unaffected, allowing articles to move forward with temporary placeholder images until the generation service is fully restored.

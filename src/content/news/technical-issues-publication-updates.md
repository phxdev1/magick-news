We are currently experiencing technical difficulties with our image generation system. This is temporarily affecting our ability to generate header images for new articles. Our engineering team is actively working to resolve these issues. The article content has been fully reviewed and approved for publication, with the header image to be added once the image generation capabilities are restored. We appreciate your patience as we work to deliver our usual high-quality content presentation.
